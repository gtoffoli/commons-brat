# commons-brat

This is part of the client-side section of the Javascript application **https://github.com/nlplab/brat**, packaged as a *Django application*.

I'm using it in the CommonS Platform (**https://github.com/gtoffoli/commons**), for visualization of results of text-analysis based on the NLP spaCy library (**https://github.com/explosion/spaCy**).
