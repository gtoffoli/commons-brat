# commons-brat

This is a selection of the client-side components of the Javascript application **brat rapid annotation tool (brat)**,  *https://github.com/nlplab/brat*, packaged as a *Django application*.

I'm using it in the CommonS Platform (*https://github.com/gtoffoli/commons*), for visualization of results of text-analysis based on the NLP spaCy library (*https://github.com/explosion/spaCy*).
